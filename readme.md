# Disk Explorer

Windows program that presents the filesystem as a series of lists, allowing a blind or screenreader user to navigate folders and files, open files, and launch applications.

Written in Windows Forms and .Net. No dependencies, just open in Visual Studio. 

There was a previous VB6 version, in the "VB6 Code" folder, which I think is the one actually shipping.
